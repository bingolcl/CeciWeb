# AddressBook
A simple C# WinForms Address Book application.
I wanted a no-frills place to collect contact information when sending invitations to my wedding, so I made this.

Features:
- Store contact data:
	- First name, last name, and middle initial
	- Full US Address
	- Two phone numbers
	- Email Address
	- Birthday
	- Portrait

Future ideas:
- Export contacts to / import from text
- Open email client
- Alerts for birthdays
